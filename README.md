To implement the REST API for searching, creating, and deleting "server" objects in Java, we need to follow the following steps:

1) Set up a MongoDB database to store the server objects.
2) Create a Java project and add the required dependencies.
3) Define a Server model class to represent the server objects.
4) Define a ServerService class to handle CRUD operations on the server objects.
5) Define a ServerController class to map HTTP requests to corresponding service methods.
